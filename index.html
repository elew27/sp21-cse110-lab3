            <p>Today was quite the long one. My head was hurting from lack of sleep and hydration. <strong>PSA:</strong> Bring a pad to sleep on in a tent when camping. I think I have scoliosis now. I fell asleep in the car ride which was nice but I woke up with a stiff neck. I then showered off all the dust from the desert and took a nice nap. Now, while I write this, I am finishing my CSE 110 homework.</p>

            <p>Today, I woke up at 8 because my roommate decided to play music loudly on the speakers downstairs. That was awesome. I then got vaccinated which I'm super happy about. I got home, then went to UTC Mall with my roommates, where none of us got anything. After that, we packed the car and drove to Blair Valley. Upon arrival, we had an argument about <em>who</em> left the burger patties at home(it was Nate). We then went hiking up mountains and had an awesome view for sunset.</p>

            <p>Today, I woke up for class and then decided to go on a run since I hadn't worked out in a while. When I got back, I did some homework til the afternoon. I got bored afterwards and decided to walk around downtown La Jolla to just take pictures. I ended up going to bed early because I was extremely tired from the run, however my roommates were playing smash til late and kept me up.</p>
